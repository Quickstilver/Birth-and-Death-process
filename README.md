# Birth-and-Death-process

This Python-based project simulates the growth and decline of a population using a stochastic model that takes into account random events like births and deaths.

## Key Features:

- Customizable birth (a), death (b), and remain alive (c) rates to simulate various population scenarios.
- The model is built on a discrete-time Markov chain with three possible events at each time step: birth, death, and no change.
- Runs for 100 time units (T), showcasing the changes in population size over time.
- Calculates the expected time (E(T_i)) it takes for the population to move from one state to another.

## Visualizations:

A line plot showing the population size over time, providing a clear view of the population's growth or decline.
A line plot displaying the expected time it takes to move from one state to another (E(T_i)), offering insights into the dynamics of the population.

## Conclusions:

By exploring this project, I gained a deeper understanding of stochastic models and how they can be used to study population dynamics in various contexts. This project is perfect for those interested in Data Science, ecology, or just curious about the fascinating world of simulations!
